just some random tailwind class.

=> sr-only : Use sr-only to hide an element visually without hiding it from screen readers
basically it hides the element from the user. Its there but its not visible i think.

=> peer: i really dont know what this means. But it adds some sort of animation i guess. Ui is not my forte.
